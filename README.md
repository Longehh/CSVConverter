# CSVConverter
This is a Spigot Plugin which depends on ShopGUIPlus, on load it will loop through all shops and get their items buy & sell prices. Once it's done it
export each shop into .csv format i.e. blocks.csv.

You can then import these .csv files into Excel, or Google Sheets.

I decided to publish this as it makes eco sheets a lot easier.

automation task).
